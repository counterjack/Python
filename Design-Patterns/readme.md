### Factory :

Define an interface to create object but defer object instantiation at run time. 
Usage: Django test Factory methods

### Singleton
Allow only one object to create
Usage: Logger, Terminal, DB Connection


### Builder
Helps in building complex logic using simple objects. It builds the final object step by step


## Strategy
Used in various framewors to provide users a way to change the behaviour of a class without extending.
